         <p style="background-color:powderblue;">Let me just tell you that being a student in todays society is not always easy.Adults often tell us that we dont know what stress is and to just wait until we grow up.But we as teenage students have our own levels of stress.For instance,all school activities require you to uphold your grade point average to high standards,along with the expectations that you dedicate any extra time to it day and night.Then,getting your homework turned in on time seems simple, but you still hope to have a life outside of school as well.Many students in their high school years start their first job, so now you have school in the mornings, followed by responsibilities needing to be taken care of at home and then youre off to work. </p>
